Everything looks great and the data validation was great, you couldnt even type a letter if it was supposed to be a number. Everything was desgined very well and the responsiveness is good too for both mobile and tablet but the backgrounds look wonky only a few times on mobile. Other than that i see no flaws as each api works as does the page they are one and is very functional and styled with react!
